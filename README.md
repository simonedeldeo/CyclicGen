Video frame interpolation algorithms predict intermediate frames to produce videos with higher frame rates and smooth view transitions given two consecutive frames as inputs. We propose that: synthesized frames are more reliable if they can be used to reconstruct the input frames with high quality. Based on this idea, we introduce a new loss term, the cycle consistency loss. The cycle consistency loss can better utilize the training data to not only enhance the interpolation results, but also maintain the performance better with less training data. It can be integrated into any frame interpolation network and trained in an end-to-end manner. In addition to the cycle consistency loss, we propose two extensions: motion linearity loss and edge-guided training. The motion linearity loss approximates the motion between two input frames to be linear and regularizes the training. By applying edge-guided training, we further improve results by integrating edge information into training. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

## Requirements setup
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

* To download the pre-trained CyclicGen models and HED model:

    * [ckpt_and_hed_model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X7PWDY2nAx8ZeSLso5qeypRUCDokNFms)

## Data Preparation
* [Deep Voxel Flow (DVF)](https://github.com/liuziwei7/voxel-flow)

## Usage
* Run the training script for stage 1:
``` bash
python3 CyclicGen_train_stage1.py --subset=train
```
* Run the training script for stage 2:
``` bash
python3 CyclicGen_train_stage2.py --subset=train --pretrained_model_checkpoint_path=./ckpt/CyclicGen/model
```
* Run the testing and evaluation script:
``` bash
python3 CyclicGen_train_stage1.py --pretrained_model_checkpoint_path=./ckpt/CyclicGen/model --subset=test --batch_size=1
```
* Run your own pair of frames:
``` bash
python3 run.py --pretrained_model_checkpoint_path=./ckpt/CyclicGen/model --first=./first.png --second=./second.png --out=./out.png
```
Note that we provide two baseline models: 1) original DVF ```CyclicGen_model.py```, and 2) DVF with more layers in order to increase the receptive field ```CyclicGen_model_large.py```. While test on UCF-101 dataset, we use the ```CyclicGen_model.py``` network. The motions in Middlebury dataset are much larger than UCF-101, some even exceed the receiptive field of DVF network. So we use ```CyclicGen_model_large.py``` for fine-tuning and testing. You can easily switch between these two models by changing the line 

```from CyclicGen_model import Voxel_flow_model``` 

to 

```from CyclicGen_model_large import Voxel_flow_model```.
